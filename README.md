# CS207_Phone_Locator_And_Email_Using_Blynk
--------------------------------------------

The point of this repository is to explain how phone locator works and how to send email using Blynk. 

The project works really simply, whenever the user presses a button, The Arduino Uno will read the phone's geolocation and send the client an email.Another cool feature added  is that when a phone is lost or stolen, a phone owner can e-mail using blynk, so that the person canâ€™t get the information which is stored in that phone. A response from the Arduino will be received in about 15-20 seconds from the press of the button if the phone is located.
